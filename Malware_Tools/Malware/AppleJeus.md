# AppleJeus

## Overview

AppleJeus is a sophisticated cryptocurrency-themed malware family developed by the Lazarus Group (North Korean state-sponsored threat actor). The malware disguises itself as legitimate cryptocurrency trading software to target cryptocurrency businesses and users.

## Observed Behavior & Capabilities

### Version History
- **AppleJeus Version 6**: Dorusio variant distributed through dorusio[.]com
- **Previous versions**: Various cryptocurrency wallet applications

### Key Capabilities
- **Credential Theft**: Harvests cryptocurrency wallet credentials and private keys
- **Data Exfiltration**: Steals sensitive financial and personal information
- **Persistence**: Establishes long-term access to compromised systems
- **Network Communication**: Uses HTTPS for command and control communications

### Delivery Methods
- **Malicious Websites**: Distributed through compromised or fake cryptocurrency trading platforms
- **Social Engineering**: Targets users seeking cryptocurrency trading software
- **Supply Chain**: Sometimes distributed through legitimate-looking company websites

## Technical Details

### File Characteristics
- **File Extensions**: Typically distributed as executable files (.exe)
- **Digital Signatures**: May use stolen or fake code signing certificates
- **Packing**: Often obfuscated to evade detection

### Network Behavior
- **C2 Communication**: Uses HTTPS over standard ports (443)
- **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS-based command and control
- **Encryption**: Communication may be encrypted to avoid detection

## Detection Methods

### Network Detection
```suricata
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"AppleJeus - Potential C2 Communication"; content:"|HTTP/1.1 200 OK|"; flow:established,to_server; sid:2025100601; rev:1;)
```

### Host Detection
- **Process Monitoring**: Look for suspicious cryptocurrency-related processes
- **File System**: Monitor for unusual files in cryptocurrency wallet directories
- **Registry**: Check for persistence mechanisms in Windows registry

### Behavioral Indicators
- **Unusual Network Traffic**: HTTPS connections to suspicious domains
- **File System Changes**: Creation of suspicious files in wallet directories
- **Process Behavior**: Processes attempting to access cryptocurrency wallet files

## Mitigation Strategies

### Prevention
- **Software Verification**: Verify authenticity of cryptocurrency software before installation
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate cryptocurrency-related systems
- **User Training**: Educate users about cryptocurrency-related threats

### Detection
- **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy EDR solutions with cryptocurrency-specific rules
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious HTTPS traffic patterns
- **Log Analysis**: Regular analysis of system and network logs

### Response
- **Incident Response**: Have procedures for cryptocurrency-related incidents
- **Forensic Analysis**: Preserve evidence for cryptocurrency theft investigations
- **Recovery**: Ensure backup and recovery procedures for cryptocurrency wallets
