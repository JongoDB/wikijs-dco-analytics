# Clop

## Overview

Clop is a sophisticated ransomware family that has been observed in various cybercriminal campaigns. This ransomware is designed to encrypt files on compromised systems and demand payment for decryption, often accompanied by data exfiltration threats.

## Observed Behavior & Capabilities

### Primary Functions
- **File Encryption**: Encrypts files on compromised systems
- **Ransom Demands**: Displays ransom notes demanding payment
- **Data Exfiltration**: May exfiltrate data before encryption
- **System Disruption**: Disrupts normal system operations

### Key Capabilities
- **File Extension Changes**: Changes file extensions to .clop
- **Network Communication**: Communicates with C2 infrastructure
- **Persistence**: Establishes persistence on compromised systems
- **Evasion**: Uses various evasion techniques to avoid detection

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Type**: Ransomware
- **Platform**: Windows-based systems
- **Communication**: HTTP/HTTPS for C2 communication
- **Persistence**: Various persistence mechanisms

### Network Behavior
- **Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS for C2 communication
- **Encryption**: Uses encryption for C2 communications
- **Beaconing**: Regular beaconing to C2 infrastructure
- **Data Exfiltration**: May use C2 channel for data theft

## Detection Methods

### Network Detection
```suricata
# Clop Ransomware File Extension
alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"Clop - Ransomware File Extension Change"; content:".clop"; file_extension; sid:2025104031; rev:1;)

# Clop Ransomware Activity
alert smb any any -> any any (msg:"Clop - Ransomware Activity"; content:"|SMB encryption attempt|"; sid:2025104032; rev:1;)

# Clop C2 Communication
alert http any any -> any any (msg:"Clop - C2 Communication"; http_uri; content:"/c2"; sid:2025104033; rev:1;)
```

### Host Detection
```powershell
# Clop process detection
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -match "clop" -or $_.CommandLine -match "clop"}

# Clop file extension changes
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\" -Recurse -Filter "*.clop" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Behavioral Indicators
- **File Extension Changes**: Files renamed with .clop extension
- **Network Connections**: Unusual outbound HTTP/HTTPS connections
- **Process Creation**: Suspicious process creation patterns
- **Registry Modifications**: Unusual registry modifications

## Hunting Queries

### Splunk Searches
```splunk
# Clop file extension changes
index=filesystem* (file_name="*.clop" OR file_extension="clop")
| stats count by host, user, file_name, file_path

# Clop network activity
index=network* (url="*c2*" OR url="*clop*") OR (user_agent="*clop*")
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, url, user_agent
```

### KQL Queries
```kql
// Clop file extension changes
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName endswith ".clop" or FileName contains "clop"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName

// Clop network detection
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemoteUrl contains "clop" or RemoteUrl contains "c2"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName
```

## IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)

### File Indicators
- **File Extensions**: .clop
- **File Names**: [Known Clop file names from threat intelligence]
- **File Hashes**: [Known Clop file hashes from threat intelligence]

### Network Indicators
- **C2 Domains**: [Known C2 domains from threat intelligence]
- **IP Addresses**: [Known C2 IP addresses]
- **Ports**: 80, 443 (HTTP/HTTPS)

### Behavioral Indicators
- **Process Names**: Suspicious process names
- **Registry Keys**: Unusual registry modifications
- **File Paths**: Suspicious file creation patterns

## Mitigation Strategies

### Prevention
- **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy EDR solutions with ransomware detection
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious network connections
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls
- **Patch Management**: Keep systems updated with latest security patches

### Detection
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- **Process Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious process creation
- **File System Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious file operations
- **Registry Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious registry modifications

### Response
- **Incident Response**: Have procedures for ransomware incidents
- **Forensic Analysis**: Preserve evidence for investigation
- **System Recovery**: Use clean backups for system recovery
- **Data Recovery**: Implement data recovery procedures
