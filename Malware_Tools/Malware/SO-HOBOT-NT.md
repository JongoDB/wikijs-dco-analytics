# SO-HOBOT-NT

## Overview

SO-HOBOT-NT (SOHO Router Botnet) is a sophisticated botnet infrastructure operated by Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, particularly associated with Volt Typhoon. This malware targets small office/home office (SOHO) routers to establish covert multi-tier networks for persistent access and data exfiltration.

## Observed Behavior & Capabilities

### Primary Functions
- **Router Compromise**: Targets vulnerable SOHO routers and network devices
- **Botnet Infrastructure**: Creates covert multi-tier network architecture
- **Persistent Access**: Establishes long-term access to compromised networks
- **Data Exfiltration**: Facilitates data theft through compromised infrastructure

### Target Infrastructure
- **SOHO Routers**: Small office/home office network devices
- **Network Appliances**: Various network infrastructure components
- **IoT Devices**: Internet of Things devices with network connectivity

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Multi-tier Structure**: Organized as a covert multi-tier network
- **Distributed Nodes**: Compromised routers act as distributed nodes
- **Command and Control**: Uses compromised infrastructure for C2 communications

### Network Behavior
- **Protocols**: Uses various network protocols for communication
- **Encryption**: May use encryption to avoid detection
- **Traffic Patterns**: Blends with legitimate network traffic

## Detection Methods

### Network Detection
```suricata
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"SO-HOBOT-NT - Potential Botnet Communication"; content:"|suspicious_pattern|"; flow:established,to_server; sid:2025100603; rev:1;)
```

### Host Detection
```powershell
# PowerShell detection for suspicious network connections
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object {$_.State -eq "Established" -and $_.RemoteAddress -match "suspicious_pattern"}
```

### Behavioral Indicators
- **Network Scanning**: Unusual network scanning patterns
- **Router Configuration Changes**: Unexpected changes to router configurations
- **Traffic Anomalies**: Unusual traffic patterns from network devices

## Hunting Queries

### Splunk Search
```splunk
index=network* (src_ip=* OR dest_ip=*) (port=23 OR port=80 OR port=443 OR port=8080)
| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, port, protocol
| where count > threshold
```

### Network Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor for suspicious router connections
tcpdump -i any -n "host suspicious_ip and (port 23 or port 80 or port 443)"
```

## Mitigation Strategies

### Prevention
- **Router Security**: Implement strong authentication on network devices
- **Firmware Updates**: Keep router firmware updated
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate critical network segments
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls on network devices

### Detection
- **Network Monitoring**: Deploy network monitoring solutions
- **Router Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging on network devices
- **Traffic Analysis**: Regular analysis of network traffic patterns

### Response
- **Incident Response**: Have procedures for router compromise incidents
- **Network Isolation**: Ability to isolate compromised network segments
- **Forensic Analysis**: Preserve network logs for investigation
